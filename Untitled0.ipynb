Punishment has varied purposes; it not just serves the punitive aim but also aims to secure the authoritative stake of the institutional authority (Binder, 2002). In Kant\\u2019s version, it is stated as a sanction because there is deprivation of the pleasure (gain) that the offender might have received in case he had been successful in violating the norm. It should be able to frustrate the immoral ends which were aimed to be achieved. As per Bentham\\u2019s classical theory of hedonism, the pain given due to sanction/punishment should be more than the pleasure received due to the crime committed (\\u201cFine and Fining,\\u201d 1953).

With every act termed as a crime, its commission ignites social loss in the form of the harm caused and in the form of the costs involved to regulate such crime pre and post commission. To make up for the social loss suf-fered, state imposes punishment on the criminal; however, this punishment should be able to satisfy the basic penological goals which were elaborated above (Becker,\",\n",

However, when fine is awarded to achieve these ends, it loses its punitive nature and get reduced to a non- or quasi penal. In his work, Gary Becker however distinguishes between civil violation and a crime on the basis of the penalty. According to him, if it is a fine then it has to be part of civil law because it is one of the basic tenets of criminal law to award imprisonment as a punishment (Harcourt, Becker, & Ewald, 2013). It is a hidden postulation that fine is considered \\u201cless serious\\u201d than imprisonment such that if fine is ordered as a punishment in criminal law, it reduces the sanctity and effect of the concept of punishment in criminal law (Posner, 1985).

It has been argued by few theorists that fine as a penalty does have various benefits and is quite effective. But the caveat is that there needs to be a viable distinction in the pen-alty depending on the type of offense committed. If it is a heinous/grave crime, then fine may not suffice on the threshold of the theories of punishment. However, if it is a petty/minor offense, then fine can prove as an effective penalty which not just satisfies the penological objectives but also saves on the administration costs. To ensure the compliance of the punishment, especially in cases of fine, it should be taken care of that the fine awarded is affordable by the offender and is also proportional to the crime committed. This is an essential balance to seek but is quite complex in practice. If the fine ordered is too heavy and is unable to appreciate the disparity in the affordability, then it raises questions on the ends aimed to be achieved by the court and on their cred-ibility and fairness (Wheeler et al.,\",\n",

IPC was drafted in 1860; there is lack of sources to trace the value of rupee in 1860, but there are resources which state the value of rupee in 1947 and how it changed over decades (Forecast, 2015). The value of Rupee has been stated in terms with US dollar. This may not give us a certain change rate of value of currency but does offer a fair estimate. In 1947, 1 USD was equal to 1 INR, whereas in 2016, it is about 67 INR. This gives us an alarming picture that the fine which is mentioned as 10 INR in IPC should actually be 670 INR and the ones mentioned as 100 INR should be 6,700 INR, and so forth. It may not be possible to amend the IPC after every few years to update the fine but arrangements can be made to issue circu-lars or rules which give an amended chart. It has been very wisely noted that the deci-sion regarding what type of punishment has to be inflicted should be determined by the aims that are to be achieved through such an infliction. In case of retribution (desert: as offender deserves), the fine imposed achieves its retributive goal only if the greed (benefit received by the offender) involved in the offense is equivalent to the amount of fine mentioned in IPC, since the offender \\u201cdeserves\\u201d the punishment on the basis of the crime he committed. Unfortunately, in today\\u2019s scenario the fines as low as Rs. 10, 100, 200, or 500 fail miserably to satisfy any of the penological goals. Rs. 10 cannot deter any person from doing misconduct in public after being drunk. A crime as seri-ous as making fictitious stamps is punishable with an upper limit of Rs. 200 fine which instead of being deterrent or retributive is rather quite a convenient and facilitative form of punishment. The other means that can be achieved through fine is compensa-tion to victim, revenue to state (\\u201cFine and Fining,\\u201d 1953). With Rs. 250 being the upper limit punishment for an act \\u201cendangering life and public safety\\u201d is like a mock-ery of the gravity of the offense rather than being penological. When the amount of fine mentioned becomes nothing more than a colonial hangover, it should either be removed or\",\n",

This is a much preferred way of including fine as a punishment in criminal law as there is enough scope to materialize all penological goals through fine. But this may even prove harmful when there is increased inconsistency in the application of fine. The need for sentencing guidelines has been a cause of concern for decades in India. The practice of imposing punishment for a crime is an institutional one. For the smooth and consistent application of this practice, there is a requirement for sentencing guidelines. Mostly the guidelines are considered to be vague but as long as the fundamentals of sentencing are followed while giving sentence, the consistency is ensured to a certain level (Spjut,\",\n",

Time and again in various reports such as Malimath Committee (2003) and Madhav Menon Committee (2008) and in case laws, it has been stressed that there is immediate need of extensive and detailed guidelines that provide a basis to the judges to come to a decision. In the absence of such structured sentencing guidelines, it leads to undue uncertainty and indiscriminate imposition of imprisonment and fine. The need gets reinforced when an analysis of the legislative drafting of IPC is done where the punishments stated are with a huge flexible range with limits on the maximum punishment and at times on the lowest punishment as well. It is the judge\\u2019s harshness or leniency that does the guess-work for lawyers in the punishment that will be awarded instead of the objective factor such as factual circumstances of the case (Library of Congress, n.d.). Even with respect to fine, exercise of unguided discretion for the determination of amount of fine in the absence of sentencing guidelines can lead to arbitrariness and inconsistency in deci-sion making. In Arun Garg v. State of Punjab (2004) 8 SCC 251 relating to the offense of Section 304 B (Dowry Death), the Session judge ordered a fine of Rs. 2,000 along with the imprisonment, which was later increased to Rs. 2 lakhs by the high court. Interestingly, on appeal, the Supreme Court completely set aside the fine which was ordered. This is an interesting case as it deals with 304 B, which is one of the rare offenses in the IPC where imposition of fine is not prescribed at all. Moreover, the disparity and inconsistency in the application of fine by judges at the three levels reflect the utter lack of sentencing guidelines particularly with regard to the amount of fine and its\",\n",

But there is an inherent difference between fine and imprisonment, that is, the former involves money, whereas the latter involves cessation of personal liberty, stigma, mon-etary loss, and other social costs such as loss to reputation, and so on, which puts imprisonment on a much higher threshold than fine and even if considered as a price paid for offense, is not so beneficial and lucrative.

Punishment has varied purposes; it not just serves the punitive aim but also aims to secure the authoritative stake of the institutional authority (Binder, 2002). In Kant’s version, it is stated as a sanction because there is deprivation of the pleasure (gain) that the offender might have received in case he had been successful in violating the norm. It should be able to frustrate the immoral ends which were aimed to be achieved. As per Bentham’s classical theory of hedonism, the pain given due to sanction/punishment should be more than the pleasure received due to the crime committed (“Fine and Fining,” 1953). It does deter the offender and brings a heavy cost along for their career, family, and social standing (Brown, 2004). For this, the sanction should be proportionate to the crime committed such that the benefit achieved is deprived (Kant, 1998).\n",

It also necessitates the theoretical and economic analysis of criminal offenses and their punishment to answer essential questions such as which acts should be termed as criminal and how should they be punished (Malley, 2009). With every act termed as a crime, its commission ignites social loss in the form of the harm caused and in the form of the costs involved to regulate such crime pre and post commission. To make up for the social loss suf-fered, state imposes punishment on the criminal; however, this punishment should be able to satisfy the basic penological goals which were elaborated above (Becker, 1974).\n",

However, when fine is awarded to achieve these ends, it loses its punitive nature and get reduced to a non- or quasi penal. In his work, Gary Becker however distinguishes between civil violation and a crime on the basis of the penalty. According to him, if it is a fine then it has to be part of civil law because it is one of the basic tenets of criminal law to award imprisonment as a punishment (Harcourt, Becker, & Ewald, 2013). It is a hidden postulation that fine is considered “less serious” than imprisonment such that if fine is ordered as a punishment in criminal law, it reduces the sanctity and effect of the concept of punishment in criminal law (Posner, 1985). If the justification of monetary criminal sanction is compensatory, then the arising con-cern is the commodifying treatment of the crime committed, whereas if the Sharma 253\n",

It has been argued by few theorists that fine as a penalty does have various benefits and is quite effective. But the caveat is that there needs to be a viable distinction in the pen-alty depending on the type of offense committed. If it is a heinous/grave crime, then fine may not suffice on the threshold of the theories of punishment. However, if it is a petty/minor offense, then fine can prove as an effective penalty which not just satisfies the penological objectives but also saves on the administration costs. To ensure the compliance of the punishment, especially in cases of fine, it should be taken care of that the fine awarded is affordable by the offender and is also proportional to the crime committed. This is an essential balance to seek but is quite complex in practice. If the fine ordered is too heavy and is unable to appreciate the disparity in the affordability, then it raises questions on the ends aimed to be achieved by the court and on their cred-ibility and fairness (Wheeler et al., 1990).\n",

This gives us an alarming picture that the fine which is mentioned as 10 INR in IPC should actually be 670 INR and the ones mentioned as 100 INR should be 6,700 INR, and so forth. It may not be possible to amend the IPC after every few years to update the fine but arrangements can be made to issue circu-lars or rules which give an amended chart. It has been very wisely noted that the deci-sion regarding what type of punishment has to be inflicted should be determined by the aims that are to be achieved through such an infliction. In case of retribution (desert: as offender deserves), the fine imposed achieves its retributive goal only if the greed (benefit received by the offender) involved in the offense is equivalent to the amount of fine mentioned in IPC, since the offender “deserves” the punishment on the basis of the crime he committed. Unfortunately, in today’s scenario the fines as low as Rs. 10, 100, 200, or 500 fail miserably to satisfy any of the penological goals. Rs. 10 cannot deter any person from doing misconduct in public after being drunk. A crime as seri-ous as making fictitious stamps is punishable with an upper limit of Rs. 200 fine which instead of being deterrent or retributive is rather quite a convenient and facilitative form of punishment. The other means that can be achieved through fine is compensa-tion to victim, revenue to state (“Fine and Fining,” 1953). With Rs. 250 being the upper limit punishment for an act “endangering life and public safety” is like a mock-ery of the gravity of the offense rather than being penological. When the amount of fine mentioned becomes nothing more than a colonial hangover, it should either be removed or revamped.Section\n",

This is a much preferred way of including fine as a punishment in criminal law as there is enough scope to materialize all penological goals through fine. But this may even prove harmful when there is increased inconsistency in the application of fine. The need for sentencing guidelines has been a cause of concern for decades in India. The practice of imposing punishment for a crime is an institutional one. For the smooth and consistent application of this practice, there is a requirement for sentencing guidelines. Mostly the guidelines are considered to be vague but as long as the fundamentals of sentencing are followed while giving sentence, the consistency is ensured to a certain level (Spjut, 1985).\n",

            "Unmatched line: deadlines whether for imposing imprisonment or fine as a penalty. Time and again in various reports such as Malimath Committee (2003) and Madhav Menon Committee (2008) and in case laws, it has been stressed that there is immediate need of extensive and detailed guidelines that provide a basis to the judges to come to a decision. In the absence of such structured sentencing guidelines, it leads to undue uncertainty and indiscriminate imposition of imprisonment and fine. The need gets reinforced when an analysis of the legislative drafting of IPC is done where the punishments stated are with a huge flexible range with limits on the maximum punishment and at times on the lowest punishment as well. It is the judge’s harshness or leniency that does the guess-work for lawyers in the punishment that will be awarded instead of the objective factor such as factual circumstances of the case (Library of Congress, n.d.). Even with respect to fine, exercise of unguided discretion for the determination of amount of fine in the absence of sentencing guidelines can lead to arbitrariness and inconsistency in deci-sion making. In Arun Garg v. State of Punjab (2004) 8 SCC 251 relating to the offense of Section 304 B (Dowry Death), the Session judge ordered a fine of Rs. 2,000 along with the imprisonment, which was later increased to Rs. 2 lakhs by the high court. Interestingly, on appeal, the Supreme Court completely set aside the fine which was ordered. This is an interesting case as it deals with 304 B, which is one of the rare offenses in the IPC where imposition of fine is not prescribed at all. Moreover, the disparity and inconsistency in the application of fine by judges at the three levels reflect the utter lack of sentencing guidelines particularly with regard to the amount of fine and its need.\n",

The article has previously established that how in case of minor/petty offenses where the harm can be quantified in monetary terms or where the deterrence required is quite small, fine does play an efficient role as it quali-fies in achieving penological goals and also proves to be cost effective in its adminis-tration. Had it been such that in IPC, such alternative option was provided only for petty offenses, it would have been acceptable, but not for the offences such as “Culpable Homicide, Death by Negligence, voluntarily causing grievous hurt, sexual harassment, assault, etc. where the nature of offense is not by far imagination petty or minor (See Table 2). When a death is caused, a fine alone cannot create a deter effect, nor can achieve retributive effect. In such cases, the loss suffered by the victim or its families cannot be quantified in monetary terms as it deals with privacy, humanitarian, and liberty rights. Fine as a punishment in such cases, and especially when and if the amount mentioned is as low as discussed in the article previously, leads to commodi-fication of the crime.\n",

Can it be concluded that by paying fine, it is essentially the price paid for buying the offense just as any other commodity (Malley, 2009). However, this argument can even be stretched for other type of punishment, that is, imprisonment. But there is an inherent difference between fine and imprisonment, that is, the former involves money, whereas the latter involves cessation of personal liberty, stigma, mon-etary loss, and other social costs such as loss to reputation, and so on, which puts imprisonment on a much higher threshold than fine and even if considered as a price paid for offense, is not so beneficial and lucrative. Moreover, when fine is accepted as a penalty for heinous crimes such as murder and rape, it demeans the harm and the pain caused to the victim and the society’s collective conscience at large (Becker, 1974). Not just it demeans, it will indirectly provide a price and a license for commis-sion of such offenses in exchange of a price (Malley, 2009). If the price (fine) set is\n",
